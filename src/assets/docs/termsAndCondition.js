1. Application

These Terms of Service set out the general terms governing your use of the Website. They apply to you as soon as you first use the Website, and you are deemed to have agreed to be bound by them upon your first use of the Website. If you do not wish to continue to be bound by these Terms of Service, please stop using the Website now.

2. Relationship to Other Agreements

In addition to these Terms of Service, our privacy policy also sets out details of how your personal data will be used. Together, these are the “Website Agreements”.
During the course of your use of the Website, you may choose to agree to be bound by certain other agreements: for example, if you wish to sign up to DJELIN, you will need to agree to a Membership Agreement, and if you wish to invest in a business through DJELIN, you will need to agree to the relevant Investment Agreement. We refer to all of these other agreements as the “Platform Agreements”, because rather than just governing your technical use of the Website, they set out the substantive terms that govern your relationship with us when you make use of our platform.
The Website Agreements will continue to apply to you even after you have agreed to a Platform Agreement. However, if it turns out that there is a conflict between the Website Agreements and a Platform Agreement that you agree to, the Platform Agreement will take precedence.

All of the Content is the property of DJELIN, our affiliates or third parties with whom we do business, and this means that it is protected by Germany and international intellectual property laws and other relevant laws. This means thatyou may not reproduce, copy, distribute, store or in any other fashion re-use material from the Website unless otherwise indicated on the Website or unless given express written permission to do so by DJELIN.

Additionally, even if we include a link to another website on this Website, that does not mean that we endorse that other website or in any way recommend that you should use it.
